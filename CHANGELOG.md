# Changelog

## HEAD
### Removed
- [BREAKING] Dropped vendor-related mixins in favor of mandatory [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer): `ekzo-vendor()`, `ekzo-placeholder()` and `ekzo-keyframe()`
- [BREAKING] Dropped mixin `ekzo-headings()`. It was never used.
- Dropped `$ekzo-line-height-ratio` variable â€” there isn't much sense to keep it in settings by default, since can be easily calculated on demand. Were never used.
- `ekzo-font-size-classes()` no longer accepts `$name` parameter. For generation of single font-size class should be used new mixin `ekzo-font-size-class()`

### Added
- Added options `$ekzo-widths-columns` and `$ekzo-responsive-widths-columns` to control generated widths
- Added option `$ekzo-ns` which allows to set global namespace for class names. By default set to `''`
- Added `.h-overflow-x--auto` helper, which can make tables friendlier to small screens
- Added options to control namespacing for class types: `$ekzo-generics-ns`, 
`$ekzo-objects-ns`, `$ekzo-components-ns`, `$ekzo-scopes-ns` and `$ekzo-helpers-ns`
- Added `ekzo-font-size-class()` mixin for generation of single font-size class
- Added functions and mixins names in error messages
- Added `$ekzo-enable-widths` option for enabling/disabling widths
- Added `ekzo-rem()` function, which converts pxs into rems
- `ekzo-font-size-classes()` mixin now accepts `$postfix` parameter
- `ekzo-breakpoint()` now accepts 3 parameters: `breakpoint`, `path` and `map` (backward compatible)

### Changed
- `grid` now generated by mixin
- [BREAKING] Renamed `_framework.scss` to `_index.scss` for better clarity
- [BREAKING] All classes by default namespaced by its type. For example: `o-grid` instead of `grid`
- [BREAKING] Renamed function `map-get-deep()` to `ekzo-get()`
- [BREAKING] Renamed function `ekzo-convert-direction()` to `ekzo-flip-direction()`
- [BREAKING] `ekzo-breakpoint()` mixin now produces better class names. For example: `1/2@lap` instead of `lap-1/2`
